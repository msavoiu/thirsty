# Thirsty

## About
I live in Southern California, where the weather is pretty warm year round. No one knows better than us the importance of staying hydrated, but that doesn't mean it's always the easiest.

I created this app as a personal project to combine my passions for software engineering and environmental sustainability. The goal is simple: make it easy for anyone to find and share the locations of water stations around the world, encouraging people to carry and refill reusable bottles instead of buying single-use plastic.

One of the biggest problems with sustainable living is it's not always the most convenient. Thirsty looks to change that by letting people know before they go, or while they're out and about, where they can get access to free, clean drinking water without buying a bottle at the store.
